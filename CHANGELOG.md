## [2.0.0] - 2017-07-30

### Changed

- Specified version numbers for all dependencies, due to Chalk dropping support for older Node versions

  This may be a **breaking change** if you depend on a newer release of any dependency, so you can continue using 1.2.2 in that case. 

## [1.2.2] - 2016-06-29

### Changed

- Now passes the error back to GulpUtil.PluginError

## [Older]

I'm not going to go through the old history at this point.
